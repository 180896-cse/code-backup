
JAVA :

1) Write a program to reverse all comment lines from any linux shell script. In shell script first character of comment line is #.
The program should display number of comment lines removed from that program.

2) Write a program to hide a small message like any name "Albert" in some image file(.jpg) using LSB bit substitution method as follows : 
   Skip 5000 bytes from the beginning of the image file. Convert the secret message to bits. Take one bit at a time and substitute in LSB position of image file
   from 5001 byte position. Display the modified image on screen. Extract the secret message from stego image file.
   Step 1 : Convert secret message to bits
   Step 2 : Take 1 byte from image. Convert into bits.

3) Input any number such as 47315329 as a string. Read first digit and then extract same number of digits from 2nd position. Multiply that extracted number by 3.

4) Input two numbers say a,b. Ask for option "add", "sub", "prod", "Div" from user and then calculate accordingly. Try to use applet.

5) Input principal, rate of interest and year of investment. Calculate compound interest and total amount.

6) Solve linear simultaneous equations using (i) Gauss Elimination method, (ii) Gauss Seidal method.

7) Calculate value of integral using Simpson's 1/3rd rule : I = 1/(1+x)dx 0 to 1.

8) Solve differential equation using 4th order Runge Kutta method.

9) Write a program to input a list of names. Modify each name to "Surname, Name". Sort the modified names in alphabetical order. Write all sorted modified names
   in some output file.

10) Write a program to input a pattern to be searched in a file and new pattern to be replaced in the input file name. Search the file for old pattern and replace
    it by new pattern. Program should also display how many times the pattern found and replaced by new pattern.

11) Write Java Applet to design Indian National Flag. Use proper color in the flag.

12) Write a program to read data of a file and convert each byte to 8 bits. Complement all prime position bits. Perform XOR operation between bit-1 and bit-2 and
    substitute in bit-2 position. Similarly bit-3 with bit-4 then substitute in bit-4 position. Continue upto bit n-1 and bit n. Reverse the whole bit pattern and
    then again complement the bits in prime position of the bit pattern. Read 2 consecutive bits and convert those bits to DNA sequence as follows :
    00 = A, 01 = T, 10 = C, 11 = G. Write the DNA sequence in some output file.

4) Write a program in 'c' to implement mid point sub division method to find clipped portion within a viewing window.

5) Sutherland Cohen Algorithm.

6) Implement seed fill algorithm.

7) Write program in C-language to move a thick circle along sin(x) curve.

8) Apply composite transformation on a rectangle say ABCD : (i) Rotation by 90 degree. (ii) Reflection along y=x
   Display original rectangle and the modified rectangle.

9) Apply composite transformation on a triangle ABC : (i) Rotate by 90 degree. (ii) Reflection along x-axis.
   Draw initial and modified triangle.

10) Design a Smiley face with eyes, pupil, nose, mouth, ear, etc. Write your roll number and name below Smiley Face.

11) Write a program in 'c' to move one circle along x-axis from left to right and one circle from top to bottom along y-axis.

12) Reflect a triangle ABC about a line y = x + 2. The position of the vertices are A(5,15), B(15,15), C(10,20). Display initial and transformed triangle.
