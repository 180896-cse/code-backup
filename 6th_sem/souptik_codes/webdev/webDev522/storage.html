		<p align="center">Storage refers to holding information somewhere. RAM(Random Access Memory) is short-term<br/>
			memory. It is volatile memory that is automatically &quot;erased&quot; when the power is turned off or interrupted.<br/>
			The RAM memory is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. A motherboard is not the keyboard<br>
			The keyboard is what you type with. A motherboard holds RAM memory, electroni ccircuits and other computer<br/>
			parts including the CPU. ROM(Read-only-memory) isn't volatile, meaning that the memory is still there when power<br/>
			is interrupted or turned-off. When the computer is turned back on again, ROM memory is still in storage on the <br/>
			internal hard disk.
