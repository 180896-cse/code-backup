		<h2>Use of margin auto</h2>
		<p>You can set margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its containers. The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split between the left and the right margins.</p>

		<div>
			<center>This div will be horizontally centered because it has margin : auto; </center>

			Whose woods there are I think I know.
			His house is in the village though;
			He will not see me stopping here
			To watch his wounds fill up with snow.
.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep;
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
